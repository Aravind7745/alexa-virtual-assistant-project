This is a Python project that simulates a virtual assistant similar to Amazon's Alexa. The program listens for voice commands and responds to them 
by performing various tasks like,
Saying hello
Telling the current time
Opening websites
Playing YouTube videos
Searching Google
Performing calculations
Telling jokes
Opening Windows programs

The project also includes functionality for taking screenshots and opening certain Windows programs like camera, settings, notepad..etc. 
The assistant is activated by the word "alexa" followed by a command from the user.

Overall, this program is a good demonstration of how to create a virtual assistant using Python and various libraries. It can be further customized 
and extended to add more functionality and features.
